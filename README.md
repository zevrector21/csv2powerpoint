## Common Fixes when settign up a machine
*  Save your own screenshot for the save button
    - You need to do this if LibreOffice isn't finding a save button
    - After doing this you may still have to check 'always save' the first time
    - You may need to go to the progam and back to your terminal when running

* Linux, the program was not able to read the path  os.path.exists('inputs\save.png')  [Missing file save.png error (resolved)]
    - This needs changed to be:  `os.path.exists('inputs/save.png')` in every file. 

* Linux:  update this line in all files :   `args = ['C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\soffice', '--impress', '--nologo', ppt_output_filename]`
`args = ['loimpress', '--nologo', ppt_output_filename]. (Make sure the libreoffice is installed and it can be opened in the terminal by just writing:  loimpress )`
